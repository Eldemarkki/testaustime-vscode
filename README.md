# testaustime-vscode

Official TestausTime VSCode extension.

## How to use?

You need to open the command palette `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and select `TestausTime: Set API key` and then enter your API key.

If you don't want to use the official server at `https://time.lajp.fi`, you can use the `TestausTime: Set custom API endpoint` to use an unofficial server.
